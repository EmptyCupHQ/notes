# Guidelines from common feedback from PR


1. **Use a clear and descriptive title for the PR.**
Avoid vague titles like `Updated` — they don’t communicate what changed. A good PR title summarizes the intent of the changes.

✅ Good examples:
- `Fix: Remove __pycache__ and .db files`
- `Refactor: Rename component files for consistency`
- `Chore: Clean up console.log statements`

---

2. **Don’t commit `__pycache__` or `.pyc` files.**
These are automatically generated by Python and should not be versioned. They clutter the repo and vary across environments.

- Add these to `.gitignore`:
    ```
    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    ```
- Set this in your environment to prevent local writes:
    ```
    export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
    ```

---

3. **Don’t commit `venv/` or `.venv/` folders.**
Virtual environments are local to your machine. They contain OS-specific binaries and shouldn't be checked into git.

- Add to `.gitignore`:
    ```
    venv/
    .venv/
    ```

---

4. **Don’t include `.db` files or other binary files.**
SQLite or binary files are not portable, cause merge conflicts, and should never be committed.

✅ Instead:
- Use seed scripts or migrations
- Add to `.gitignore`:
    ```
    *.db
    ```

---

5. **Don’t commit machine-dependent or generated files.**
Avoid committing:
- IDE configs (e.g. `.vscode/`)
- Build outputs (`*.log`, `*.bin`, compiled files)
- `.DS_Store`, `.log`, etc.

Keep your commits clean and portable across systems.

---

6. **Remove `console.log()` statements before submitting.**
These should not be left in the production code unless explicitly needed for logging. Use a logging utility if required.

---

7. **Fix spelling mistakes in filenames and identifiers.**
Example:
❌ `VedioPlayer.svelte`
✅ `VideoPlayer.svelte`

Spelling mistakes hurt searchability and reflect poorly on code professionalism.

---

8. **Use consistent capitalization for component files.**
Follow PascalCase for Svelte components:
✅ `Button.svelte`
❌ `button.svelte`

- Backend python files should be all smalls. For eg: `renders.py`
- Multi word file names should be avoided. If absolutely needed, `_` should be used for space. For eg: `api_routes.py`

This avoids confusion and bugs on case-sensitive filesystems (e.g., Linux) and keeps the file structure consistent.

---

9. **Follow RESTful naming conventions for API routes.**
We already discussed this during your interview assignment.
Avoid actions like `/getProjectDetails`. Instead:

| Action            | Method | RESTful Route           |
|-------------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Get user info     | GET    | `/users/:id`             |
| Create project    | POST   | `/projects`              |
| Update project    | PUT    | `/projects/:id`          |
| Delete a resource | DELETE | `/resources/:id`         |

---

10. **Avoid Adding Unnecessary Dependencies.**
You’ve added **Flask Blueprints**, but this project has a **simple backend structure** that doesn’t require modular routing at this stage.

❗ Always avoid introducing plugins, architectural patterns, or external libraries unless absolutely necessary.

Why it matters:
- Every dependency increases maintenance and onboarding complexity
- It adds abstraction that may not be justified for smaller projects
- Makes debugging and testing more complex

✅ Stick with Flask’s built-in `@app.route` decorators unless:
- The project is large enough to benefit from modular separation (e.g., `auth`, `user`, `admin`)
- There is a real and current need for abstraction

---

16. **Dependency Philosophy.**
- Don’t add external libraries or modules unless they are **absolutely necessary**
- Prefer standard libraries and built-in patterns where possible

Before adding a dependency, ask:
- Can this be done simply with what's already available?
- Will this make the project harder to maintain?
- Are there multiple contributors familiar with this tool?

> 🧠 Keeping things simple makes the project easier to maintain and scale.

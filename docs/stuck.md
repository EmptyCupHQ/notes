# Getting Stuck

> [Stuckness shouldn't be avoided. It's the psychic predecessor of all real understanding.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7122380-if-your-mind-is-truly-profoundly-stuck-then-you-may)

> An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It's this understanding of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything except a new situation.

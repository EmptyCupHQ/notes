# Guidelines


#### Composing a note

- Don't explain in detail. Keep the info concise. Each point must not be more than 3-4 sentences.
- Add links to external sources for elaborate reading. But summarize the external source in the note.
- Link to other docs whenever possible. As this repository is built for reference, each note may be read independently. Having a quick link to another note that clarifies a concept or gives background is very helpful.
